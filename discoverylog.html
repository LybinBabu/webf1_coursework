                On this week I learned about information and social engineering. The lecture was about, how easy it is for someone to manipulate you on to disclosing your password. It can be simple questions like “where did you go to school?” or “what was your him life like?”. Since you share your secrets with you mates, they know about your private life. Social engineering techniques are: Phishing, impersonation, physical access, shoulder surfing, dumpster diving, fake software(trojans).

                On this week I learned about literature review. It is a process for reviewing literature. In other words, it is “a formal evaluation of the written academic research on a particular subject.” I learned that a literature review identifies what has been done before, strengths and weaknesses of a research, the context of future work. A literature review should be unbiased, objective and reliable. Literature review improves your information seeking skills, text scanning skills, critical appraisal skills.

                In this week I learned about Academic writing. It has few steps that you need to consider when you are doing academic writing. And they are, Voice, Guidance (good and bad), editing and references. Voice means that you need to consider the target audience (you are not writing this for yourself). Your academic writing needs to look like its is evidence based, evaluative, thoughtful, logical, neutral and structured. Your academic writing shouldn’t include sophistication, over use of brackets, streams of consciousness, avoid informality, avoid contractions.

                Usability: poor UI design can have serious consequences. The reason why you should get the UI right is because, the user’s time is valuable, design it correctly now or it will cost more later. User Demographics: locale, Age, technical expertise, cultural background, how much time they have to do things, Domain specific expectations, personality, other pertinent factors. Your site should be design from a robust set of requirements gathers from real users.

                Accessibility: “The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.” the website needs to be perceivable. Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need. Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure. Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background. The website needs to be operable. This means make all functionality available from a keyboard. Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures. Make sure your website is understandable. The text content needs to be readable and understandable. The website needs to be robust. Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.
