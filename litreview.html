        <h1>Mitigating personal information exposure on the web</h1>
        <p>
            In this literature review I am going to talk about people like us leaving data footprints
            on the internet, and people who are willing to disclose their details on the web for
            their convenience. I will be talking about how we expose our details without us
            knowing on the web and how it can be useful to others who receive information
            about us through the web. I also will be talking about data collection on mobile apps.
        </p>
        <h2>E-Commerce</h2>
        <p>
            Many studies have investigated how people expose their data on the web both with
            and without their knowledge. One study shows the negative side and the positive
            side of sharing user data with companies on the web. This can be seen in two
            perspective. The first being why websites collect data on you is to recommend you
            better things on their website and to give you a personalised list of recommended
            things. The other perspective would be: the reason why websites collect data on you
            is so then the company could share that with third parties to make money. We as a
            user could never find out why exactly is the reason they collect data on us, they
            never disclose what they collected as well. Studies shows that e-commerce websites
            like amazon and ebay, provides the users with personalised lists of recommended
            products based on their previous purchases and searching trends (Lee and
            Cranage, 2018). “Online travel agencies such as Expedia and Travelocity also
            provide personalised products and services by recommending travel packages
            based on favourite destinations, offering lists of available hotels and flights for trips,
            providing price comparisons, and allowing customers to plan their trips as easily and
            quickly as possible.” (Lee and Cranage, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
            These useful features persuade the customers to choose personalised services over
            ordinary services and that make them think personalised services is more
            advantageous. Using the data they collected from the users, e-commerce websites
            usually sent out emails to the customers on new deals and / or new products they
            have in stock. This is while giving the user and option to opt out from these email
            subscriptions and give the user the control of their own information, so that the user
            will be more comfortable to share their information to the company in the first place.
            Even though there is an option to opt-out, you can never guarantee that even after
            you opted-out the company removed every information they have on you (maybe
            there is a back up) (The Commerce Shop, 2018).
        </p>
        <h2>Mobile Apps</h2>
        <p>
            Due to the quick evolution of smartphone technology; developments of social
            medias, mobile gaming and cloud storages have helped the development of variety
            software’s to please existing and future mobile users. Advertisers have started to
            prefer mobiles apps to spread their adverts because the adverts will be more
            precisely targeted to a specific person rather than multiple people. Because
            website-based adverts will not be specific to one person because there are higher
            chance that, the laptop or pc could be used by more than one person, whereas
            nowadays everyone have their own mobile phones, data collected from that mobile
            phone will be unique and will be specific to one person.
        </p>
        <p>
            Applications that now is available will collect all or most of these information about
            you and they include: user’s location, gender, age, interest, other personal
            information like contact details. “According to the Pew Internet Project survey, 85%
            of adults believe it is very important to control access to their personal information. It
            is estimated that about 54% of users have refused to download an app and 30% of
            app users have deleted an app for privacy reasons. Additionally, one in five mobile
            app users have disabled the location tracking feature on their phone, and one in
            three regularly delete their cell phone browsing or search history entries” (Pentina et
            al., 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
            However, there is people out there who is willing to disclose sensate very personal
            details in return for more personalised mobile services that provide relevant
            information to you. An example for this would be google cards. By analysing your
            searches and location details, google cards will provide you daily news articles and
            event notifications on your phone. “When the service is free, the product is your
            data”(Polykalas et al., 2018). Every time when you install an app to your phone you
            are prompted to select what permissions you want to grant the app you just
            downloaded. There are certain apps that won't work if you dont grant the permission
            to access the things the app is asking for, so the moment you grant permission your
            personal data is sent to the app’s developers servers. (Polykalas et al., 2018)
            another example for why big companies like google collect data and what they do
            with it, are for to improve responses you get from the searches and responses from
            A.I. Using the data collected from you, they can be used to improve the A.I and its
            recommendations to you (Tavakoli, 2018). “Mobile users usually install applications
            that are relevant to their frequent rituals and routines. For example, someone using
            local means of transportation would be expected to install applications through which
            he can check the schedules. Someone in the real estate business is likely to install
            applications that would rapidly allow him explore real estates online. Hence,
            applications on a mobile phone indicate clues about the lifestyle and interests of the
            user. Although processing the data collected from smartphones is very attractive,
            usually the data is not available to the research community” (Yalcin, 2018).
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            In conclusion, there are lots of ways to mitigate the risk of leaving data footprints on the
            internet, but it all depends on you, as you get to choose what can be sent to the
            developers system. This can be done by choosing different settings on the app or
            the account carefully to sort out what informations about you can be sent over to the
            servers. Like for example in mobile apps or mobile phones you can choose to turn
            your location off, delete your browsing history, give fake details bout you, or choose
            what details about you can be collected by the apps/mobiles developer. Or you can
            just turn everything on and let the developer collect information on you so you will
            get a more personalised ads and service. When you allow the developer to collect
            the data, he/she can use that data for good causes or bad causes. They could use
            the data to personalise the service they provide to you or sell that information and
            make money.
